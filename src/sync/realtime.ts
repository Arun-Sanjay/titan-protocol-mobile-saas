/**
 * Supabase Realtime subscription for the signed-in user.
 *
 * Opens one channel scoped to the user, listens for INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE
 * on every `SYNCED_TABLES` member filtered to `user_id=eq.<userId>`. On each
 * event we:
 *   1. Apply the change to the local SQLite cache (bypassing `cloudUpsert`
 *      because we're receiving FROM cloud, not writing TO it)
 *   2. Invalidate React Query so any open screen re-renders
 *
 * Server-side requirements (one-time, see migration
 * `enable_realtime_publication`):
 *   - Each synced table must be added to the `supabase_realtime` publication
 *   - Each table must have `REPLICA IDENTITY FULL` so DELETE events carry
 *     the full row (we need the primary key from the OLD record to remove
 *     it from SQLite)

 *     Applying the event would drop the user's offline edit — or, for a

 *     deleted. The dirty-row flush + catch-up resync reconcile it later
 *     against the server.
 *   • Non-delete events are MERGED over the existing local row, not blindly
 *     replaced: Postgres can omit unchanged TOAST-able columns (long text /
 *     json) from an UPDATE payload, and a blind `INSERT OR REPLACE` would
 *     null them in this device's cache until a full resync.
 *   • An event older than what we already hold (by `updated_at`) is ignored
 *     — Realtime can deliver out of order after a reconnect.
