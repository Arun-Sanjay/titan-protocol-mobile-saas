/**
 * Dirty-row replay. The hybrid `cloudUpsert` mirrors locally with
 * `_dirty = 1` whenever the cloud write fails (network blip, server 5xx,
 * Supabase token glitch) so the user's data isn't lost. This module is
 * the second half of that bargain: scan every synced table for `_dirty=1`
 * rows and retry them.
 *
 * Invoked by `RealtimeProvider` on:
 *   • user-id change (first land after sign-in)
 *   • AppState transitions to `active` (returning from background; covers
 *     the common "phone was offline, now back online" path)
 *
 * Concurrency: one flight at a time. A second call while one is in
 * progress is a no-op rather than queueing — if there are still dirty
 * rows when the first flight ends, the next trigger picks them up.
 *
 * Replay order: FK parents before children. Postgres enforces the
 * references the local cache doesn't, so an offline-created task + its
 * completion must arrive in that order or the child 23503s on the first
 * round.
 *
 * Failure semantics: a transiently failing row stays `_dirty=1` and is
 * retried on the next flush. A row that keeps failing (unique/FK/RLS
 * conflict that will never clear) is ABANDONED after
 * `MAX_REPLAY_ATTEMPTS`: marked `_dirty=2`, loudly logged, and excluded
 * from future scans — one poison row must not block the catch-up restore
 * forever (resync skips the pull while `_dirty=1` failures remain). The
 * next successful restore replaces abandoned rows with cloud truth.
